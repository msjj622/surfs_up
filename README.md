As you can see the line chart above, Urban city type has more afforability on fares and more demands comparing to other city type. It has more rides, more drivers. Although, the average fare per ride and driver is lower than other city type, the total fares are much higher.

As you can see the multiple-line chart above, the urban city type has more affordability which means it has more demends and the fare would be higher due to the high demands. For Pyber, a ride-sharing comany can have a good profit if we can focus on the services more in urban.

Other recommendations, in Rural area, Giving them discount for ride-sharing fares and see if they are willing to expend more. I think we have to know what would be reason that the residents in rural area wants to use ride-sharing serives to get more business ideas for the next steps.
